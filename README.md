## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria Met

The following criteria have been successfully implemented:

### Core Requirements
* **User Display:** Fetches users from `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` and displays Name, Email, Username, and Actions (Edit/Delete) in an MUI Table.
* **CRUD Operations:** Implements Add (POST), Edit (PUT/PATCH), and Delete (DELETE) actions using RTK Query mutations.
* **Data Persistence Logic:** Utilizes **Optimistic Updates** and custom Redux configuration to enforce client-side persistence against the non-persistent mock API.
* **UI/UX:** Uses MUI Dialogs for Add/Edit/Delete confirmation and handles loading/error states gracefully.

### Bonus Features (Impressive)
* **Search Functionality:** Includes a functional search bar that filters users by Name, Username, and Email.
* **Notifications:** Implements Snackbar notifications for success and error feedback on all CRUD operations.
